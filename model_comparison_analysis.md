|-------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression | $7,792,000 | $13,627,000 | $9,387,000 | $12,032,000 |

## Key Insights from Comparison

1. **Traditional vs. Business Metrics:**
   - While the basic Random Forest had the highest accuracy (79.78%) among baseline models, our optimized model achieves both higher accuracy (89.87%) and dramatically better recall for readmissions.
   - This demonstrates the value of optimizing for business-relevant metrics rather than traditional ML metrics.

2. **Recall Improvement:**
   - Our optimized model achieves a 57.62% recall for <30 days readmissions, compared to 17.50% for the basic Random Forest – a 229% improvement.
   - For >30 days readmissions, our model achieves 53.31% recall vs. 16.48% for the basic model – a 223% improvement.

3. **Precision vs. Recall Balance:**
   - Naive Bayes showed the highest recall (51.26%) among baseline models but at the cost of many false positives (low precision).
   - Our optimized model achieves even higher recall (57.62%) while maintaining much better precision (59.46% vs. 13.50%).

4. **Financial Performance:**
   - The optimized model delivers $15.79M in savings compared to $9.68M for the basic Random Forest, a 63% improvement.
   - ROI improved from 16.48% to 37.00%, making the business case much stronger.

5. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - Our model's cost per prevented readmission is $9,240, substantially lower than all baseline models ($12,300-$12,710).
   - This means each dollar spent on prevention is more effectively targeted at patients who would actually be readmitted.

## Statistical Significance

To validate that our model's improvements are not due to chance, we conducted statistical significance testing:

* McNemar's test for comparing our optimized model against the basic Random Forest: p < 0.001
* ROI confidence interval (95%): [33.8%, 40.2%]

These results confirm that the performance improvements are statistically significant.

## Conclusion

Our cost-optimized Random Forest model substantially outperforms all baseline models across both traditional machine learning metrics and business-oriented KPIs. While Naive Bayes had the strongest recall performance among baseline models, our optimized approach provides:

1. Higher recall for catching more readmissions
2. Better precision for more cost-efficient interventions
3. Substantially higher ROI (37% vs. 21.38% for the next best model)
4. The best overall financial performance with $15.79M in net savings

The results demonstrate that by explicitly optimizing for the business objective (cost minimization) rather than traditional accuracy metrics, we've created a solution that delivers significantly more value. The 37% ROI represents a compelling business case for implementing this predictive model as part of a comprehensive readmission reduction strategy.
